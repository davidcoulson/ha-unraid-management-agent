## Home Assistant Quality Scale & Standards

<!-- Check all that apply to confirm compliance with modern Home Assistant development standards -->

- [ ] Verified against the [Home Assistant Developer Docs](https://developers.home-assistant.io/) and Quality Scale (Platinum target)
- [ ] Uses `entry.runtime_data` exclusively (zero `hass.data[DOMAIN]` usage)
- [ ] All entities inherit from `UnraidBaseEntity` and set `_attr_has_entity_name = True`
- [ ] Services/actions registered in `async_setup()` with full schema validation (not `async_setup_entry()`)
- [ ] Sensor entities use `native_value` / `native_unit_of_measurement` (no deprecated properties)
- [ ] Uses `async_get_clientsession(hass)` for all HTTP/WebSocket connections
- [ ] Entities read from `coordinator.data` (no direct API/network calls in entity classes)
- [ ] Diagnostics data is properly redacted via `async_redact_data()`
- [ ] Not applicable (documentation-only or metadata change)
